# Frontend Mentor - Fylo dark theme landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This project is being updated and refactored as I learn new things!

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- Parcel
- Netlify

### What I learned

I learned... a lot. This was the first time I used Sass in a bigger project and I loved it! Perhaps I went a bit overboard with nesting media queries but for me personally, it's just makes the code more readable when I don't have to scroll all the way down on a page for them, but I find each one of them where they are actually relevant.
This was also the first time I tried having separate development/build using Parcel and then deploy my site with Netlify. At first I found it a bit overwhelming, but with some research and help I managed :)

### Continued development

This project made me realise that there's so much about Flexbox I still don't know. I'll spend more time filling in those gaps (unintended pun) in my knowledge in the near future!
I definitely need to experiment more with Sass!
